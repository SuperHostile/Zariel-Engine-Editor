The Zariel Engine Editor is a graphical editor for the Zariel Engine written with the GUI library Slab. This library has been modified to work well with Windows. Zariel's GUI library isnt mature enough to start creating "heavy" programs like this, so for now, i'll be using Slab for this project.
I can't guarantee this will turn into something production ready, but is a little neat experiment to see how I can expand both the engine and Slab.
